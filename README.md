Capital adequacy refers to the ability of a bank to maintain sufficient capital to cover its risks. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is a measure of a bank's capital in relation to its risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The CAR is given by:
CAR = Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets
Where:
Capital includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, which are the bank's core and supplementary capital.
Risk-Weighted Assets are the bank's assets weighted by risk factors to reflect their potential risk of loss.


Stress scenarios are hypothetical situations that simulate extreme economic or financial conditions. These scenarios are designed to assess the impact of adverse events on a bank's balance sheet. Each scenario includes assumptions about losses on assets and potential increases in liabilities. For example, a stress scenario might involve a severe economic recession, a sharp decline in asset values, or a significant increase in credit defaults.


Under stress scenarios, the bank's balance sheet is impacted in two key ways:
1) Asset Losses: The value of the bank's assets may decrease due to market downturns, credit defaults, or other adverse events. The reduction in asset value is represented as:
Stressed Assets = Assets * (1 - Asset Loss Rate)
Where Asset Loss Rate is the percentage loss in the value of the bank's assets under the stress scenario.
2) Liability Increases: The bank's liabilities may increase due to higher funding costs, withdrawal of deposits, or other factors. The increase in liabilities is represented as:
Stressed Liabilities = Liabilities * (1 + Liability Increase Rate)
Where Liability Increase Rate is the percentage increase in the bank's liabilities under the stress scenario.

After applying the stress scenario, the bank's capital and capital ratio are recalculated. The stressed capital is the difference between the stressed assets and stressed liabilities:
Stressed Capital = Stressed Assets - Stressed Liabilities

The stressed capital ratio, which reflects the bank's capital adequacy under the stress scenario, is given by:
Stressed Capital Ratio = Stressed Capital / Stressed Assets

Banks are required to maintain a minimum capital ratio as set by regulators. The most commonly used standards are the Basel III requirements, which mandate a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a minimum total capital ratio of 8%, and additional buffers for systemic risks.


Define Stress Scenarios:
Identify the key risk factors (e.g., market risk, credit risk, operational risk) and define severe but plausible scenarios that could negatively impact these factors.

Apply Stress Scenarios:
Simulate the impact of each scenario on the bank's assets and liabilities. Calculate the resulting stressed capital and capital ratio

Assess Capital Adequacy:
Compare the stressed capital ratio with the regulatory minimum capital requirements. Determine if the bank maintains sufficient capital under each scenario.

Mitigation and Action Planning:
If the stress tests indicate potential capital shortfalls, the bank must develop mitigation strategies, such as raising additional capital, reducing risk exposures, or adjusting business strategies.

Stress testing is an essential process in ensuring that banks can survive extreme financial shocks by maintaining adequate capital levels. It involves defining adverse scenarios, simulating their impact on the bank's balance sheet, and assessing whether the bank's capital is sufficient to cover the risks. This process helps banks and regulators ensure the stability and resilience of the financial system.
